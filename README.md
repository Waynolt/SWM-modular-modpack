# SWM Modular Modpack
​
## <span style="color:red"> **Disclaimer** </span>
PLEASE MAKE A POST IN THE REBORN EVO FORUM IF YOU HAVE ISSUES WITH ANY OF THESE MODS.<br />
https://www.rebornevo.com/forums/topic/24930-swm-modular-modpack-e1840
<br />

You can also find this modpack's files versioned on GitHub:<br />
https://github.com/Waynolt/SWM-modular-modpack 
<br />

This modpack is for **Reborn**; if you're looking for a Rejuvenation-compatible version, you can find it here:<br />
http://www.rebornevo.com/forum/index.php?/topic/33807-rejuvenation-modular-modpack-v11-patch-3/
<br />

--------------------------------------------------

<br />

## <span style="color:purple"> **Installation** </span>

To **install**, just drop the folder "**Mods**" into the folder "**[Reborn]\patch**"<br />
(In the end you should have a "**[Reborn]\patch\Mods**" folder with a bunch of files inside.)<br />
This old video from **Lostelle** explains it, showing each step required (it's a bit outdated - for example the location changed - but it's still good): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hc3Mo432C0
<br />
 
If playing on a **Mac** with **Wineskin**, then, as **Tacos** suggests, do all the modding in a Reborn folder outside of the wrapper and then make a new wrapper with that folder (I have absolutely no idea whether this still applies though).

Every component is **stand-alone**, and can be used on its own; please refer to the "**brief summary**" below for more info on each one.

<br />

--------------------------------------------------

<br />

## <span style="color:blue"> **Brief summary of each mod component** </span>

 

**(Please remember to check and delete the components you do not want when you are installing this mod pack!)**

 
<details>

* "**SWM - AAA**": this mod is a trap. It only exists to crash the game for people who dump everything in without reading the Readme.<br />
Please don't warn other players about this - doing so defeats the purpose of this mod.
<br />

* "**SWM - AutoDex**": this mod automatically updates your Pokedex by marking all species and forms in an evolutionary line as seen and captured whenever you catch a new Pokemon.<br />
The evolutionary line of event Pokemon will be updated after the next battle.<br />
Notifications for added entries can be enabled by editing the "SWM - AutoDex.rb" file and setting the global variable "$swm_autoDex_showNotification" at the start to true.
<br />

* "**SWM - ChooseStarter**": while you are in the starter selection room, you can select your starter (as if you wanted to give it an item) and use the "Change starter" option to randomize or choose its species.
<br />

* "**SWM - ConsistentRandomness**": tries to keep random rolls the same every time you reload your save, providing a consistent experience. You can't reload hoping for a lucky crit that didn't happen already, but you can expect that that lucky Toxic hit will happen again if you make the same choices. Also prevents streaks in random rolls: for example, if you get a 6 on a six-sided die, you're guaranteed not to see another 6 in the next 5 rolls, helping keep outcomes balanced without changing the odds.
<br />

* "**SWM - EvOverflow**": if your mon's EV in any stat would go over 252, without breaking the 510 overall limit, then you are offered the choice to improve its IV, at the cost of resetting that EV.<br />
If instead you use friendship berries at 0 EV you are offered the choice to reduce the IV.<br />
Use the password "noevcap" to disable EVs being lowered to make room for new gains when reaching the 510 overall limit.
<br />

* "**SWM - GlamazonShop**": Hi, I’m Jeff Beldum, CEO of glamazon.pkm and renowned specialist in Teleporting Pokemon.<br />
Our new branch in the Reborn region brings the world of online shopping directly to your PC!<br />
No more backtracking to PokeMarts or running out of supplies in the middle of a Gym battle. With Glamazon Shop, you can browse and order items remotely from any store you have access to.<br />

<br />

* "**SWM - ItemRadar**" changes the ItemFinder so that, when activated, it stays on and marks hidden items on the game map.<br />

<br />

* "**SWM - LearnEggMoves**" lets the move relearner teach any egg move.
<br />

* "**SWM - MiningForRich**": while mining the wall won't collapse, but mining further costs cumulatively more and more money (spent on materials to build a tunnel, of course :P ).
<br />

* "**SWM - NoTMXAnimations**" hides the TM animations for using Cut, Strength, etc, out of battle.
<br />

* "**SWM - PredictRelationshipValues**" makes the move Psychic usable out of combat, and using it lets you know each npc's relationship value.
<br />

* "**SWM - ReusablePremierBalls**": Premier Balls in the vanilla game are kind of boring - they're just normal balls, which makes them just a small discount for buying balls in bulk.<br />
With this mod they become reusable - using them on a wild mon won't actually decrease their number in your bag.<br />
They also act like a decentralized unit: their catch rate is a lot lower than their normal catch rate, but scales linearly with how many you have, with no cap.<br />
(Their catch rate with the mod becomes the same as the vanilla one when you have 50 of them in your bag)
<br />

* "**SWM - SharedPC**" makes the last box in the PC shared amongst savegames: mons you put in it will be there if you start a new game or load a different savegame.<br />
If updating from E18: please note that you have to load up your latest savegame and save once in E19 in order to use the Shared Box in a new game.
<br />

* "**SWM - SnappyMenus**" makes menu transitions instantaneous.
<br />

* "**SWM - TypeBattleAnnouncer**" causes the announcer to say the species and typing of opponent mons about to enter the field instead of their names.
<br />

* "**SWM - TypeBattleIcons**" shows each mon's type in battle.
